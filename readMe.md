### What is the objective?

As part of their online offer a training business wants to be able to validate a subscriberâ€™s name,
email address and credit card number when they book a course.

I am creating a validated form for this based on a number of user stories. The card number also needs to pass the Luhn algorithm.

This is to be done in HTML, CSS and javascript
